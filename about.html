  <p>Summary about the project: 
Focusing on the subject of Building an online presence, I use my recent experience of starting a YouTube Channel, Still Learning with Jas, to navigate the start of establishing your online presence. 
    Throughout the website you’ll watch a 4-part video series where I break down what I’ve learned and breaking down some definitions. 
    Instead of commenting on the actual YouTube channel, so the audience does not have to log-in to their accounts, I’ve inserted a comment section where the audience can comment whatever they want under each video. 
    Between the audience interacting with the videos and making comments, this will demonstrate the pipeline between artist, platform, and audience.</p>
